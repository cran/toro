Create interactive maps that can keep up with complex visualisations and large datasets,
with this useful interface to the [MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/)
library. Users can create maps directly in the console, or as an HTML widget within 'Shiny' web
applications, and render spatial data quickly with many customisable options (clusters, custom
icons, map layers, and backgrounds). The goal of the package is to make it easier to interpret
and explore large spatial datasets within the context of a 'Shiny' dashboard, without having long
loading times waiting for a map to update with new data.
